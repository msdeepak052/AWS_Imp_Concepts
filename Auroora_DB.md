## ✅ What is **Amazon Aurora**?

**Amazon Aurora** is a **fully managed relational database engine** built by AWS, designed for **high performance, scalability, and availability**.

It is compatible with:

* **MySQL** (up to 5x performance)
* **PostgreSQL** (up to 3x performance)

> ✅ Aurora combines the **speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases** with the **simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source** databases.

## ✅ Aurora Modes

| Mode              | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provisioned**   | You specify instance size (db.r6g.large, etc.)                               |
| **Serverless v2** | Auto-scales in fine-grained increments (perfect for unpredictable workloads) |

---

## ✅ Pricing Considerations

* **Pay-per-use** (per second for Serverless v2)
* **Storage billed per GB-month**
* **IOs billed per million requests**
* **Backtrack and backups incur additional charges**

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Use Reader Endpoint** for read scaling.
2. Enable **Backtrack** for non-production DBs or to undo accidental updates.
3. Use **Aurora Global DB** for cross-region low-latency applications.
4. Enable **automatic minor version upgrades** for patches.
5. Monitor using **Performance Insights** to analyze bottlenecks.

---

1. Go to **RDS > Create Database**
2. Select **Aurora**, choose engine (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
3. Select **Serverless v2** or provisioned
4. Set DB identifier, admin credentials
5. Choose **VPC, subnets, and security groups**
6. Enable backups, Performance Insights, etc.
7. Launch and connect via endpoint shown in details
