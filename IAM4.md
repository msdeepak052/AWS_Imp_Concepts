#  IAM Root User Best Practices Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

 **AWS root user** is the most powerful entity in your AWS account ‚Äî it has **full unrestricted access** to all AWS resources. Because of this, AWS **strongly recommends minimizing its use** and securing it properly.

Let‚Äôs focus on **best practices** for the **root user**, especially around **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

---

## üîê What is the AWS Root User?

* The **root user** is created when you first open an AWS account.
* It is associated with the **email address and password** you used to create the account.
* It has **complete control** over all AWS resources and billing information.

## ‚úÖ Root User Best Practices (with a focus on MFA)

| üîí Practice                                   | ‚úÖ Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Enable MFA**                             | Enforce **hardware or virtual MFA** on the root user for added security.                    |
| **2. Do NOT use root user for daily tasks**   | Create an **admin IAM user** and use that instead.                                          |
| **3. Use strong, unique password**            | Use a **long complex password** not shared with any other service.                          |
| **4. Store credentials securely**             | Keep root email and recovery options secure. Use a **password manager**.                    |
| **5. Don‚Äôt create access keys for root user** | If already created, **delete them immediately**. Use IAM roles/users instead.               |
| **6. Use AWS Organizations for control**      | Manage permissions via **Service Control Policies (SCP)**, not root user access.            |
| **7. Monitor root user activity**             | Enable **AWS CloudTrail** and set alerts for any root activity using **CloudWatch alarms**. |

## ‚úÖ Enable MFA for Root User (Step-by-Step)

### üîπ Step 1: Sign In as Root

* Go to: [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* Use **email address and password** (not IAM user)

### üîπ Step 2: Go to IAM Dashboard

* Search for **IAM** in the AWS Console
* Click **Dashboard**

### üîπ Step 3: Enable MFA

1. In **Security Status** ‚Üí Find **‚ÄúActivate MFA on your root account‚Äù**
2. Click **‚ÄúActivate MFA‚Äù**
3. Choose **MFA type**:

   * ‚úÖ **Virtual MFA device** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
   * üîê **Hardware MFA device** (like a YubiKey)
4. Follow prompts to scan QR code and enter two OTPs

‚úÖ Once complete, your root account is protected with **MFA**.

---

## üö® Important: Never Create Access Keys for Root User

* AWS root **access keys allow full programmatic access**, making them highly dangerous.
* If created, delete them:

  * Go to IAM ‚Üí Security credentials (root account) ‚Üí Access keys ‚Üí Delete

---

## üîç Monitor Root Usage

Use **AWS CloudTrail** to detect root user actions:

### Example: CloudTrail Event for Root Sign-in

```json
{
  "eventName": "ConsoleLogin",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "Root",
    "principalId": "123456789012"
  },
  ...
}
```

### Set CloudWatch Alarm:

* Filter: `userIdentity.type = "Root"`
* Action: Send email via SNS for any root activity

---

## üö´ What Root User Should Be Used For Only:

| Task                                                            | Reason              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Change AWS support plan                                         | Only root can do it |
| Close AWS account                                               | Root-only           |
| Manage some billing info                                        | e.g., tax settings  |
| Activate IAM access to billing console                          | Initial setup       |
| Enable/Disable AWS services like Organizations or Control Tower | Root-only           |

## üß† Summary: Secure Root with MFA

| üîê Feature              | Status                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Strong password         | ‚úÖ Required              |
| MFA enabled             | ‚úÖ Strongly recommended  |
| Access keys deleted     | ‚úÖ Best practice         |
| CloudTrail monitored    | ‚úÖ Essential             |
| IAM used for daily work | ‚úÖ Yes, avoid using root |

### Here's a **Terraform example** that sets up **CloudTrail + CloudWatch Logs + Alarm + SNS Notification** to alert you **whenever the AWS Root user performs any action** (e.g., login, API call).

## üìß After Terraform Apply

* You will receive a **confirmation email** to the address you used in `aws_sns_topic_subscription`.
* Once you **confirm**, the SNS will be active.
* Any **root login or API call** will trigger the alarm and send you an alert.

---

## üîê Bonus Security Tip

You can also trigger **AWS Lambda or EventBridge automation** from the alarm for:

* Disabling root access keys (if any exist)
* Revoking sessions
* Triggering an incident workflow
