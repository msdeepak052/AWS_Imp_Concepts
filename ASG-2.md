### Let's dive into **Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Termination Policies** in detail ‚Äî covering:

* What termination policies are
* All available options
* Behavior of each policy with examples
* How to configure them via the **AWS Console**

---

## üîç **What Are ASG Termination Policies?**

ASG **termination policies** determine **which EC2 instances should be terminated first** when the Auto Scaling Group needs to reduce capacity ‚Äî such as during scale-in or manual adjustments.

They are important for:

* **Preserving balanced capacity** across AZs
* **Avoiding premature termination** of preferred or newer instances
* **Managing cost and performance**

---

## üß© **All Termination Policy Options (in order of evaluation)**

You can specify one or multiple policies ‚Äî AWS evaluates them **in order**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Default**

* **Behavior:** AWS uses the following sequence:

  1. Instance in the AZ with most instances
  2. Instance with oldest launch configuration
  3. Oldest instance

**Use Case:**

> Basic scaling without specific preference

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **OldestInstance**

* **Terminates:** The **oldest EC2 instance** in the group (based on launch time)

**Use Case:**

> Rolling out new app versions or replacing aging instances

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **NewestInstance**

* **Terminates:** The **most recently launched instance**

**Use Case:**

> Revert to a stable version by removing newly added instances

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **OldestLaunchConfiguration**

* **Terminates:** Instance using the **oldest Launch Configuration** or **Launch Template version**

**Use Case:**

> Gradual rollout of new AMI/template by replacing old-template instances

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **ClosestToNextInstanceHour**

* **Terminates:** Instance closest to the **next billing hour** to optimize cost (mainly for hourly billing)

**Use Case:**

> Cost-optimization when scaling in frequently (note: less relevant for per-second billing types)

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Default**

* This is a **fallback** that ensures a termination always happens, using built-in logic.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **OldestLaunchTemplate**

* **Terminates:** Instance running the **oldest launch template version**

**Use Case:**

> Similar to `OldestLaunchConfiguration`, but for template-based groups

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **AllocationStrategy**

* Only applies to **Mixed Instances Policy**.
* Terminates instance types that are **least desired or most expensive**.

**Use Case:**

> Cost control in spot/on-demand mixed environments

---

### üß™ **Example Scenario**

#### Scenario:

* ASG has 6 instances:

  * 3 in AZ `us-east-1a`
  * 3 in AZ `us-east-1b`
* 2 are using old AMI (launch config), 4 are newer.

You set termination policy:

```bash
["OldestLaunchConfiguration", "OldestInstance"]
```

üîÅ **When scale-in happens:**

* AWS first looks for instances using the **old launch config**.
* Among them, the **oldest** will be terminated.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Configure Termination Policies from AWS Console**

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step

1. **Go to AWS Console > EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups**
2. Select your ASG
3. Click on the **‚ÄúDetails‚Äù** tab
4. Scroll down to **Termination Policies**
5. Click **‚ÄúEdit‚Äù**
6. Choose from the dropdown (you can select multiple and order them)

   * e.g., `OldestLaunchConfiguration`, then `OldestInstance`
7. Click **‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù**

### üß† **Tips and Best Practices**

| Goal                         | Recommended Policy                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gradual instance replacement | `OldestInstance` or `OldestLaunchConfiguration`         |
| Rollback new deployment      | `NewestInstance`                                        |
| Cost optimization            | `ClosestToNextInstanceHour`                             |
| Maintain AZ balance          | Always keep `Default` at end (AWS handles AZ rebalance) |
| Replace older AMIs           | `OldestLaunchTemplate` or `OldestLaunchConfiguration`   |

## üìò Terraform Equivalent (Optional)

```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "example" {
  name                 = "asg-example"
  ...
  termination_policies = [
    "OldestLaunchConfiguration",
    "OldestInstance",
    "Default"
  ]
}
```

| Policy                      | Terminates                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `OldestInstance`            | Instance launched earliest              |

| `OldestLaunchConfiguration` | Instance with oldest launch config      |
| `OldestLaunchTemplate`      | Instance with oldest template version   |
| `ClosestToNextInstanceHour` | Instance closest to next hourly billing |
| `AllocationStrategy`        | Least desired type in mixed policy      |
| `Default`                   | AZ-balanced fallback logic              |
