#  IAM Root User Best Practices Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

 **AWS root user** is the most powerful entity in your AWS account — it has **full unrestricted access** to all AWS resources. Because of this, AWS **strongly recommends minimizing its use** and securing it properly.

Let’s focus on **best practices** for the **root user**, especially around **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

---

## 🔐 What is the AWS Root User?

* The **root user** is created when you first open an AWS account.
* It is associated with the **email address and password** you used to create the account.
* It has **complete control** over all AWS resources and billing information.

---

## ✅ Root User Best Practices (with a focus on MFA)

| 🔒 Practice                                   | ✅ Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Enable MFA**                             | Enforce **hardware or virtual MFA** on the root user for added security.                    |
| **2. Do NOT use root user for daily tasks**   | Create an **admin IAM user** and use that instead.                                          |
| **3. Use strong, unique password**            | Use a **long complex password** not shared with any other service.                          |
| **4. Store credentials securely**             | Keep root email and recovery options secure. Use a **password manager**.                    |
| **5. Don’t create access keys for root user** | If already created, **delete them immediately**. Use IAM roles/users instead.               |
| **6. Use AWS Organizations for control**      | Manage permissions via **Service Control Policies (SCP)**, not root user access.            |
| **7. Monitor root user activity**             | Enable **AWS CloudTrail** and set alerts for any root activity using **CloudWatch alarms**. |

---

## ✅ Enable MFA for Root User (Step-by-Step)

### 🔹 Step 1: Sign In as Root

* Go to: [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* Use **email address and password** (not IAM user)

### 🔹 Step 2: Go to IAM Dashboard

* Search for **IAM** in the AWS Console
* Click **Dashboard**

### 🔹 Step 3: Enable MFA

1. In **Security Status** → Find **“Activate MFA on your root account”**
2. Click **“Activate MFA”**
3. Choose **MFA type**:

   * ✅ **Virtual MFA device** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
   * 🔐 **Hardware MFA device** (like a YubiKey)
4. Follow prompts to scan QR code and enter two OTPs

✅ Once complete, your root account is protected with **MFA**.

---

## 🚨 Important: Never Create Access Keys for Root User

* AWS root **access keys allow full programmatic access**, making them highly dangerous.
* If created, delete them:

  * Go to IAM → Security credentials (root account) → Access keys → Delete

---

## 🔍 Monitor Root Usage

Use **AWS CloudTrail** to detect root user actions:

### Example: CloudTrail Event for Root Sign-in

```json
{
  "eventName": "ConsoleLogin",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "Root",
    "principalId": "123456789012"
  },
  ...
}
```

### Set CloudWatch Alarm:

* Filter: `userIdentity.type = "Root"`
* Action: Send email via SNS for any root activity

---

## 🚫 What Root User Should Be Used For Only:

| Task                                                            | Reason              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Change AWS support plan                                         | Only root can do it |
| Close AWS account                                               | Root-only           |
| Manage some billing info                                        | e.g., tax settings  |
| Activate IAM access to billing console                          | Initial setup       |
| Enable/Disable AWS services like Organizations or Control Tower | Root-only           |

# **IAM Credential Reports**
---

## 🔍 What is an **IAM Credential Report**?

The **IAM Credential Report** is a downloadable `.csv` file provided by AWS that shows the **age, status, and usage of credentials** (passwords, access keys, MFA) for **all IAM users in your account**.

It helps you **audit security best practices** and identify users who:

* Have old or unused passwords or access keys
* Lack MFA
* Haven't rotated keys recently
* Have enabled credentials that are unused

---

## 📄 What Does the Credential Report Contain?

It contains **one row per IAM user**, and includes the following key columns:

| Column                             | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `user`                             | IAM username                                     |
| `arn`                              | Full ARN of the user                             |
| `user_creation_time`               | When the user was created                        |
| `password_enabled`                 | `true` if console login is enabled               |
| `password_last_used`               | Last time password was used                      |
| `password_last_changed`            | When password was last changed                   |
| `password_next_rotation`           | When it must be rotated (if rotation is enabled) |
| `mfa_active`                       | `true` if MFA is enabled                         |
| `access_key_1_active` / `2_active` | `true` if access key is enabled                  |
| `access_key_1_last_used_date`      | Last use of access key                           |
| `cert_1_active`                    | For X.509 certs (legacy, rarely used now)        |

## 🛠️ How to Generate IAM Credential Report (AWS Console)

### 🔹 Step-by-Step

1. **Sign in to AWS Console** as admin/root
2. Go to **IAM → Access reports → Credential report**
3. Click: **“Download Report (CSV)”**

   * If not yet generated, AWS will create one within seconds
4. Open the CSV using Excel, Google Sheets, or CLI tools

---

## 💡 Example Analysis

| user     | password\_enabled | mfa\_active | access\_key\_1\_active | access\_key\_1\_last\_used\_date |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| devops   | true              | false       | true                   | 2024-12-01                       |
| auditor  | false             | true        | false                  | N/A                              |
| testuser | true              | false       | true                   | never                            |

🛡️ What we can conclude:

* `devops` needs MFA enabled.
* `testuser`'s access key is stale → disable or delete.
* `auditor` has read-only setup with MFA – good!

# **IAM Access Advisor Reports** (part of **IAM Reports**) 
---

## 📘 What Are IAM Access Advisor Reports?

**Access Advisor Reports** help you **analyze which AWS services your IAM users or roles actually use**, and when they last accessed them.

This allows you to:

* Identify **over-provisioned permissions**
* Clean up **unused access**
* Move toward **least-privilege access model**

---

## 🧠 Access Advisor vs Credential Reports

| Report Type        | Focus                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Credential Report  | Credential usage (keys, MFA, etc.) |
| **Access Advisor** | **Service-level access history**   |

---

## ✅ Use Cases for IAM Access Advisor

| 🔍 Goal                              | 💡 Value                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Reduce over-permissioned IAM roles   | Know which services are *not being used* |
| Audit last accessed services         | Check stale/unused permissions           |
| Enforce least privilege              | Only allow what’s actually needed        |
| Role or user permission right-sizing | Clean up policies over time              |
| Compliance & risk reduction          | Reduce blast radius of access            |

---

## 🛠️ How to Use IAM Access Advisor Report (AWS Console)

### 🔹 Step-by-Step for IAM **Users**

1. Go to **IAM → Users**
2. Select a specific **IAM User**
3. Click the **“Access Advisor”** tab
4. You'll see:

   * **Service name**
   * **Last accessed time**
   * **Status: Accessed or Not accessed**

> 🔎 This shows which AWS services this user *has permission to use*, and when (or if) they actually used them.

---

### 🔹 Step-by-Step for IAM **Roles**

1. Go to **IAM → Roles**
2. Select a specific **IAM Role**
3. Click **Access Advisor**
4. Same report is shown: which services were accessed and when

---

## 📊 Report Output Example

| Service    | Last Accessed Time | Accessed |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3  | 2025-06-22         | ✅ Yes    |
| Amazon EC2 | None               | ❌ No     |
| IAM        | 2025-06-18         | ✅ Yes    |
| CloudTrail | None               | ❌ No     |

💡 You could then remove EC2 and CloudTrail access if it's not needed.

---

## ⚙️ Filtering or Exporting Reports?

While **not directly downloadable via Console**, you can:

* Use **AWS CLI** to get similar data (see below)
* Use **Access Analyzer + CloudTrail** for deeper analysis

---

## 📦 Access Advisor via AWS CLI (Per User or Role)

```bash
aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
  --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Deepak
```

Then fetch the details:

```bash
aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details \
  --job-id <job-id-from-previous-command>
```

Output includes:

* **Services last accessed**
* **Last authenticated time**
* **Actions allowed in each service**

---

## 🧰 Example: Use Case in DevOps

### 🎯 Scenario: You have a role `EKSAdminRole` with full access to EC2, IAM, EKS, S3

Access Advisor shows:

| Service | Last Accessed |
| ------- | ------------- |
| EC2     | 2025-07-01    |
| S3      | Never         |
| IAM     | 2025-06-29    |
| EKS     | 2025-07-01    |

✅ **Action**: Remove `s3:*` permissions from this role — it’s not needed.

---

## 🔐 Best Practices Using Access Advisor

| Practice                                                  | Why                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Review Access Advisor monthly                             | Keep permissions clean           |
| Pair with CloudTrail logs                                 | Confirm usage patterns           |
| Combine with `aws:LastUsed` condition in policies         | Enforce conditional access       |
| Use with custom scripts or tools like PMapper/CloudMapper | Deeper analysis                  |
| Always test before removing permissions                   | Avoid breaking apps or pipelines |

# **IAM Access Analyzer**

---

## 🔍 What is **IAM Access Analyzer**?

**IAM Access Analyzer** helps you **identify resources in your AWS account that are shared externally** (outside your AWS Organization or account).

🔐 It answers questions like:

* "Is this S3 bucket shared with the public?"
* "Is this role assumed by another AWS account?"
* "Is this KMS key shared with external users?"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd3f7c09-d676-4f56-b7f8-d8123ceea3bd)


---

## 📦 What Can Access Analyzer Analyze?

IAM Access Analyzer reviews **resource-based policies** for the following:

| AWS Resource Type                              | Examples                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **S3 buckets**                                 | Public buckets, cross-account buckets |
| **IAM roles**                                  | Roles that trust external principals  |
| **KMS keys**                                   | Keys accessible from other accounts   |
| **Lambda functions**                           | Cross-account function access         |
| **SQS queues / SNS topics**                    | Externally accessible queues/topics   |
| **Secrets Manager secrets**                    | With cross-account access policies    |
| **EFS file systems**, **Glue resources**, etc. |                                       |

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

IAM Access Analyzer:

1. **Creates an analyzer** scoped to your AWS account or AWS Organization.
2. **Continuously monitors** supported resources.
3. **Finds findings** where access is allowed to external entities.
4. Allows you to **archive or remediate** findings.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters (Use Cases)

| Use Case                    | Description                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Detect public access     | Find misconfigured S3 buckets, IAM roles             |
| 🛡️ Enforce least privilege | Verify no resource is shared unless intended         |
| 🧾 Prove compliance         | Show external access is restricted                   |
| 🔄 Automation               | Trigger alerts or remediation via EventBridge/Lambda |

---

5. Click **Create Analyzer**

✅ Done! Access Analyzer will now scan your account for external sharing.

---

### 🔎 Viewing Findings

* Go to **IAM → Access Analyzer → Findings**
* You’ll see a list of all findings:

  * **Resource** (e.g., S3 bucket)
  * **Finding Type**: External access detected
  * **Status**: Active / Archived
  * **Condition**: e.g., Principal `*` has `s3:GetObject`

You can **click on each finding** to:

* View the JSON policy
* Download it
* Archive the finding (if it's known/allowed)
* Remediate the policy from the same screen

## 📊 Example: S3 Bucket Exposed

### Detected Finding:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
  "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::deepak-public-data",
  "principal": "*",
  "action": "s3:GetObject",
  "effect": "Allow"
}
```

🛡️ What it means: **Anyone on the internet** can access this bucket.

✅ Fix: Update bucket policy to limit to a specific IAM principal or remove the `Allow` for `"Principal": "*"`.

## 📈 Archive a Finding

Use **Archive** if access is intentional (e.g., sharing with another AWS account).

* Select finding → Click **“Archive”**
* You can **filter out archived findings** later

---

## 🚨 EventBridge Integration (Automation)

Access Analyzer integrates with **Amazon EventBridge**, so you can:

* Send finding notifications to **SNS**, **Slack**, or **email**
* Trigger **Lambda functions** to auto-remediate risky policies

Example EventBridge rule filter:

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.access-analyzer"],
  "detail-type": ["Access Analyzer Finding"]
}
```
