# **Microservices (Loosely Coupled)** and **Monolithic (Tightly Coupled)** architectures

### üß± **Monolithic Architecture (Tightly Coupled)**

#### üîç Definition:

A monolithic architecture is a single unified unit where all the components of an application (UI, business logic, data access layer) are tightly integrated and run as a single service.

#### üîó Tightly Coupled:

All parts of the application are interdependent. A small change in one module often requires rebuilding and deploying the entire application.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Advantages**:

* **Simplicity**: Easy to develop in the initial phase due to a unified codebase.
* **Performance**: Less latency due to direct internal calls between components.
* **Easy to Deploy**: One single deployment artifact (e.g., WAR, JAR).
* **Straightforward Testing**: End-to-end testing is simpler.

#### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**:

* **Scalability Challenges**: Scaling the entire app instead of individual components.
* **Deployment Risk**: A small change requires redeploying the entire app.
* **Tight Coupling**: Difficult to adapt or replace parts independently.
* **Complexity Grows with Size**: Hard to manage large codebases over time.
* **Slower Development in Large Teams**: Code conflicts and integration issues.

---

#### üí° **Use Case (Monolithic)**:

**Banking Software** ‚Äî Core Banking Systems often start as monolithic apps to tightly control transactions, balances, and reporting in a single codebase.

---

#### üè¢ **Case Study: Early Amazon Architecture**

Amazon initially operated as a monolithic application. All operations ‚Äî browsing, checkout, payment, and recommendations ‚Äî were integrated into a single large deployable.

Over time, the growing scale made it hard to deploy changes or scale individual parts (e.g., order system vs. inventory). This led them to gradually move toward microservices.

---

---

### üîß **Microservices Architecture (Loosely Coupled)**

#### üîç Definition:

Microservices architecture breaks down the application into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs (usually REST/gRPC). Each service handles a single business capability.

#### üîì Loosely Coupled:

Each service is developed, deployed, scaled, and maintained independently. They share nothing except APIs and common data formats.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Advantages**:

* **Independent Deployment**: Teams can deploy services without affecting others.
* **Scalability**: Services can scale independently based on demand.
* **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don‚Äôt crash the entire system.
* **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different tech stacks.
* **Faster Development**: Teams can work on different services in parallel.

#### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**:

* **Complexity in Communication**: Services must communicate over a network.
* **Distributed System Challenges**: Requires resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry).
* **DevOps Overhead**: CI/CD, logging, monitoring need to be well-implemented.
* **Data Consistency**: Managing transactions across services is harder.
* **Latency**: Inter-service calls introduce latency.

---

#### üí° **Use Case (Microservices)**:

**E-commerce Platform** ‚Äî Separating services like product catalog, cart, payment, recommendations, and reviews allows each to scale and evolve independently.

---

#### üè¢ **Case Study: Netflix**

Netflix transformed from a monolithic DVD rental application to a microservices-based system to support millions of users globally.

They separated functionalities like:

* User profiles
* Recommendations
* Streaming
* Authentication
* Billing

Each microservice is independently developed and deployed, allowing Netflix to scale rapidly and deliver new features faster.

---

### üß† **Extra**

#### üìå Best Practices for Microservices:

* Use **API Gateway** to route and manage APIs.
* Implement **Service Discovery** (like Consul, Eureka).
* Ensure **Observability** (Prometheus + Grafana, ELK).
* Handle **failures gracefully** with retries and circuit breakers.
* Use **containerization (Docker)** and **orchestration (Kubernetes)**.

#### üö´ Pitfalls to Avoid:

* Don't jump to microservices without **mature DevOps**.
* Avoid splitting without clear **bounded contexts**.
* Ensure proper **data ownership and API versioning**.

# AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

**Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** is a **fully managed container orchestration service** provided by AWS. It allows you to run, scale, and secure **Docker containers** without managing your own container orchestration infrastructure.

---

### üß± ECS Architecture Components

| Component           | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task**            | A running instance of a container (or set of containers) defined in a task definition. |
| **Task Definition** | JSON blueprint specifying containers, ports, CPU/memory, IAM roles, volumes, etc.      |
| **Service**         | Maintains a specified number of tasks and optionally handles load balancing.           |
| **Cluster**         | Logical grouping of resources (EC2 or Fargate) where ECS tasks run.                    |
| **Launch Types**    | Defines the compute infrastructure: EC2 or Fargate.                                    |
| **Container Agent** | Runs on EC2 instances to register them with ECS and manage containers.                 |

---

### üöÄ ECS Launch Types

| Launch Type | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2**     | You manage EC2 instances that run the containers. You‚Äôre responsible for patching and scaling the hosts.   |
| **Fargate** | Serverless. You don‚Äôt manage any servers; you specify CPU and memory, and AWS runs the containers for you. |

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of ECS

* ‚úÖ Fully managed by AWS.
* ‚úÖ Deep integration with IAM, CloudWatch, ALB, VPC, etc.
* ‚úÖ Works well with **Fargate (serverless)** and EC2 (custom infra).
* ‚úÖ No control plane to manage (unlike Kubernetes).
* ‚úÖ Cheaper than EKS if you‚Äôre already using EC2 Spot/Fargate well.

---

### üí° Real-World Use Cases

1. **Microservices Application Hosting**

   * Host each service (user-service, auth-service, payment-service) as separate ECS services.
   * Easy scaling and isolation using ECS Services + ALB.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**

   * ECS is integrated with AWS CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, and GitHub Actions.
   * Automatically deploy new container versions on push.

3. **Batch Job Processing**

   * ECS supports running on-demand batch jobs with custom scheduling strategies.

4. **Machine Learning Model Serving**

   * Run REST APIs around ML models packaged as Docker containers.

5. **APIs and Web Apps**

   * Lightweight backend services (e.g., Flask, Node.js, Spring Boot) can be deployed behind a Load Balancer.

---

### üè¢ Example Architecture (Fargate)

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. CodePipeline builds Docker image and pushes to ECR.
3. ECS Fargate service picks the new image and deploys.
4. ALB routes user traffic to the containers.
5. CloudWatch monitors logs and performance.

---

### üìä Example Use Case: Real-Time Analytics Service

A fintech company builds a real-time analytics dashboard for users:

* Each customer‚Äôs data processor runs in a container.
* Containers are deployed on ECS using **Fargate** for auto-scaling.
* **Step Functions** trigger ECS Tasks for periodic ETL workloads.
* Logs sent to **CloudWatch**, metrics collected via **CloudWatch Container Insights**.

### üÜö ECS vs EKS vs Lambda

| Feature       | ECS                        | EKS                      | Lambda                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Model         | Container orchestration    | Kubernetes orchestration | Function-based                |
| Control Plane | Fully managed              | Partially managed        | Fully managed                 |
| Use Case      | Simpler containerized apps | Complex apps with K8s    | Event-driven apps             |
| Cost          | Lower complexity and cost  | Higher learning curve    | Cost-effective for short jobs |
| Infra mgmt    | Minimal with Fargate       | Requires K8s knowledge   | None                          |

---

### üìò Best Practices

* Use **Fargate** for serverless, auto-scaling apps.
* Use **EC2 launch type** if you need GPU workloads, spot instances, or custom AMIs.
* Keep your **task definitions modular** ‚Äî each service should have its own.
* Use **Application Load Balancer** for traffic routing based on path/host.
* Enable **Auto Scaling** for ECS services based on CloudWatch metrics.
* Centralize logging using **CloudWatch Logs** or **FireLens** with Fluent Bit.
* Use **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** to store container images securely.

---

### üîê Security Tips

* Assign minimal IAM permissions via **Task Role**.
* Enable **encryption at rest** and in transit.
* Place ECS services in **private subnets** if not public-facing.
* Use **WAF + ALB** for external traffic filtering.

---

### üß† Extra

ECS is especially good when:

* You want **tight AWS ecosystem integration**.
* You need **less operational complexity** than EKS.
* Your team isn't experienced with Kubernetes but wants containerization.

---

# AWS ECS Cluster

## üß± What is an **ECS Cluster**?

An **Amazon ECS Cluster** is a **logical grouping of resources** on which ECS tasks and services are run. These resources can be:

* EC2 instances (if using the **EC2 launch type**)
* Fargate (serverless) compute (if using **Fargate launch type**)

You don‚Äôt pay for ECS Clusters ‚Äî you pay for the compute (EC2 or Fargate) used in the cluster.

---

### üìå ECS Cluster = Logical boundary for:

* Tasks (containers)
* Services (long-running containers)
* Capacity Providers (EC2 Auto Scaling groups or Fargate)
* Networking (VPC, subnets)

---

## üí° Use Cases of ECS Clusters

| Use Case                   | Details                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Microservices Hosting**  | Host separate services (auth, payments, catalog) in one cluster.         |
| **Batch Processing**       | Run scheduled or ad-hoc jobs in ECS clusters using `RunTask`.            |
| **Multi-tenant Apps**      | Each customer or environment (dev/test/prod) can have separate clusters. |
| **Blue/Green Deployments** | Use multiple ECS clusters for different stages of deployment.            |
| **Hybrid Workloads**       | Use both EC2 and Fargate in a single cluster via capacity providers.     |

# **Amazon ECS Launch Types**

---

## üß† What Are ECS Launch Types?

In **ECS**, the **launch type** determines **how your containers are deployed and what infrastructure runs them**:

| Launch Type | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2**     | You provision and manage EC2 instances. ECS schedules containers on them.                               |
| **Fargate** | **Serverless**: You don‚Äôt manage any EC2 instances. You define CPU/memory, AWS runs containers for you. |

---

## üö¢ 1. **ECS Launch Type: EC2**

### üîç What It Is:

* You manually create an **EC2 Auto Scaling Group** or EC2 instances.
* ECS places containers (tasks) on these EC2s.
* You‚Äôre responsible for:

  * OS patching
  * Scaling EC2s
  * Monitoring and cost control

### üí° Use Cases:

* Long-running applications with **consistent resource needs**
* Applications needing **custom AMIs** or **GPU/ARM instances**
* Workloads that must run on **Spot Instances** to reduce cost
* Large legacy apps already tightly coupled with EC2

### üè¢ Example:

```bash
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name ec2-cluster
# You register EC2s to this cluster using ECS optimized AMI
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **ECS Launch Type: Fargate**

### üîç What It Is:

* **Serverless container engine**.
* You only define **vCPU, memory, networking, and container image**.
* AWS runs, scales, and patches the infrastructure.

### üí° Use Cases:

* Microservices-based apps
* APIs, event-driven apps
* Startups or teams without infra engineers
* CI/CD systems or test environments that **scale up/down fast**
* Apps needing **fine-grained billing (per second)**

### üè¢ Example:

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster fargate-cluster \
  --launch-type FARGATE \
  --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abc],securityGroups=[sg-xyz],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}" \
  --task-definition my-task
```

| **Scaling**                   | Manual or Auto Scaling Group            | Automatic (per-task basis)                 |
| **Cost Model**                | Pay per EC2 instance                    | Pay per vCPU-second and GB-second          |
| **Startup Time**              | Slower (depends on EC2 start)           | Fast (tasks start in seconds)              |
| **Custom AMI**                | Yes                                     | ‚ùå No                                       |
| **GPU/ARM support**           | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚ùå Limited (no GPU support in Fargate)      |
| **Spot Pricing**              | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚úÖ Yes (Fargate Spot)                       |
| **Security**                  | Needs hardening EC2 manually            | Built-in IAM, networking, encryption       |
| **Use Case**                  | Consistent workloads, legacy, GPU       | Microservices, APIs, test/dev, burst loads |
| **Monitoring**                | CloudWatch, custom tools (self-managed) | CloudWatch (built-in), minimal setup       |
| **Launch Simplicity**         | More complex (EC2 setup, IAM, etc.)     | Very easy (just define task + network)     |

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

| Scenario                                     | Recommended Launch Type |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Starting with containers                     | **Fargate**             |
| Cost-sensitive workloads with stable demand  | **EC2 with Spot**       |
| Need GPU or custom AMI                       | **EC2**                 |
| Want serverless scaling and low ops overhead | **Fargate**             |
| CI/CD builds and test environments           | **Fargate**             |
| Real-time analytics or APIs                  | **Fargate**             |

---

## üîö Final Summary

* **Fargate** is best for **serverless, fast-scaling, low-maintenance** use cases.
* **EC2** is ideal when you need **full control**, **customization**, or **special instance types**.

#**Amazon ECS Anywhere**


## üåç What is **ECS Anywhere**?

**Amazon ECS Anywhere** is an extension of Amazon ECS that allows you to:

> **Run and manage ECS tasks directly on your on-premises servers, virtual machines, or other cloud instances** using the same ECS control plane ‚Äî without needing to run them inside AWS.

It‚Äôs useful for **hybrid** and **edge** workloads, where compute might be located in:

* Your data center (on-premises)
* Bare metal or virtual machines
* Edge devices
* Non-AWS cloud environments (e.g., Azure, GCP)

---

## üß† How It Works

ECS Anywhere connects **external (non-AWS) instances** to an ECS cluster using the **SSM agent** and **ECS Anywhere agent**, so ECS can:

* Schedule tasks
* Monitor task health
* Send logs/metrics
* Execute commands

These instances **do not require Docker installed** ‚Äî container runtime is handled via `containerd`.

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid Workloads**       | Manage workloads that must remain on-prem due to latency, compliance, or data gravity. |
| **Single Control Plane**   | Manage cloud + on-prem containers from the same ECS Console or CLI.                    |
| **No Kubernetes Overhead** | Great for non-K8s teams who still want orchestration.                                  |
| **SSM-based Access**       | No need to open inbound ports or VPN. Secure by default.                               |

## üèóÔ∏è Example: Setting Up ECS Anywhere

### Prerequisites:

* An on-prem or VM Linux instance (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
* AWS CLI configured
* IAM user/role to generate ECS Anywhere activation
* ECS cluster created

---

### üîπ Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Create an ECS Cluster (Console or CLI):

```bash
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name deepak-anywhere-cluster
```

---

#### 2. Generate an **SSM Activation Code**:

```bash
aws ssm create-activation \
  --default-instance-name "ecs-anywhere-instance" \
  --iam-role "ECSAnywhereRole" \
  --registration-limit 1 \
  --expiration-date 2025-12-31T23:59:59Z
```

üìù Save the `ActivationId` and `ActivationCode` from the output.

You must have a role named `ECSAnywhereRole` with these permissions:

```json
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role
```

---

#### 3. Install ECS Anywhere agent on your VM:

On the on-prem or external VM:

```bash
curl -o ecs-anywhere-install.sh https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install.sh
sudo bash ecs-anywhere-install.sh --region ap-south-1 --activation-id YOUR_ID --activation-code YOUR_CODE --cluster deepak-anywhere-cluster
```

---

#### 4. Verify in ECS Console:

Go to your cluster ‚Üí You‚Äôll see the external instance registered ‚úÖ

---

#### 5. Run ECS Task on that external instance:

Create a task definition and run a task with:

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster deepak-anywhere-cluster \
  --launch-type EXTERNAL \
  --task-definition your-task-name
```

## üìä ECS Anywhere vs Traditional ECS

| Feature           | ECS EC2 / Fargate         | ECS Anywhere                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Location          | AWS infrastructure        | On-prem or other cloud        |
| Managed by AWS    | Yes                       | No (you manage the host)      |
| Container Runtime | Docker / containerd       | containerd only               |
| IAM Access        | IAM roles for EC2/Fargate | IAM via SSM activation        |
| Cost              | Pay for AWS compute       | No compute cost (pay for SSM) |
| Use Case          | Cloud apps                | Hybrid/on-prem apps           |

---

## üíµ Pricing

You **don‚Äôt pay for ECS Anywhere directly**, but:

* You are charged **\$0.006 per hour per managed instance** by **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**.
* You are not charged for ECS control plane or agent.

## üîö Summary

| Feature      | ECS Anywhere                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What it does | Lets you run ECS tasks on on-prem or external infrastructure |
| Control      | Centralized ECS control plane, remote host compute           |
| Ideal for    | Hybrid workloads, edge computing, gradual migration          |
| Requirement  | SSM + ECS agent on external machine                          |
| Billing      | Minimal (via SSM)                                            |
