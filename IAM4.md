#  IAM Root User Best Practices Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

 **AWS root user** is the most powerful entity in your AWS account ‚Äî it has **full unrestricted access** to all AWS resources. Because of this, AWS **strongly recommends minimizing its use** and securing it properly.

Let‚Äôs focus on **best practices** for the **root user**, especially around **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

---

## üîê What is the AWS Root User?

* The **root user** is created when you first open an AWS account.
* It is associated with the **email address and password** you used to create the account.
* It has **complete control** over all AWS resources and billing information.

---

## ‚úÖ Root User Best Practices (with a focus on MFA)

| üîí Practice                                   | ‚úÖ Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Enable MFA**                             | Enforce **hardware or virtual MFA** on the root user for added security.                    |
| **2. Do NOT use root user for daily tasks**   | Create an **admin IAM user** and use that instead.                                          |
| **3. Use strong, unique password**            | Use a **long complex password** not shared with any other service.                          |
| **4. Store credentials securely**             | Keep root email and recovery options secure. Use a **password manager**.                    |
| **5. Don‚Äôt create access keys for root user** | If already created, **delete them immediately**. Use IAM roles/users instead.               |
| **6. Use AWS Organizations for control**      | Manage permissions via **Service Control Policies (SCP)**, not root user access.            |
| **7. Monitor root user activity**             | Enable **AWS CloudTrail** and set alerts for any root activity using **CloudWatch alarms**. |

---

## ‚úÖ Enable MFA for Root User (Step-by-Step)

### üîπ Step 1: Sign In as Root

* Go to: [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* Use **email address and password** (not IAM user)

### üîπ Step 2: Go to IAM Dashboard

* Search for **IAM** in the AWS Console
* Click **Dashboard**

### üîπ Step 3: Enable MFA

1. In **Security Status** ‚Üí Find **‚ÄúActivate MFA on your root account‚Äù**
2. Click **‚ÄúActivate MFA‚Äù**
3. Choose **MFA type**:

   * ‚úÖ **Virtual MFA device** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
   * üîê **Hardware MFA device** (like a YubiKey)
4. Follow prompts to scan QR code and enter two OTPs

‚úÖ Once complete, your root account is protected with **MFA**.

---

## üö® Important: Never Create Access Keys for Root User

* AWS root **access keys allow full programmatic access**, making them highly dangerous.
* If created, delete them:

  * Go to IAM ‚Üí Security credentials (root account) ‚Üí Access keys ‚Üí Delete

---

## üîç Monitor Root Usage

Use **AWS CloudTrail** to detect root user actions:

### Example: CloudTrail Event for Root Sign-in

```json
{
  "eventName": "ConsoleLogin",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "Root",
    "principalId": "123456789012"
  },
  ...
}
```

### Set CloudWatch Alarm:

* Filter: `userIdentity.type = "Root"`
* Action: Send email via SNS for any root activity

---

## üö´ What Root User Should Be Used For Only:

| Task                                                            | Reason              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Change AWS support plan                                         | Only root can do it |
| Close AWS account                                               | Root-only           |
| Manage some billing info                                        | e.g., tax settings  |
| Activate IAM access to billing console                          | Initial setup       |
| Enable/Disable AWS services like Organizations or Control Tower | Root-only           |

## üß† Summary: Secure Root with MFA

| üîê Feature              | Status                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Strong password         | ‚úÖ Required              |
| MFA enabled             | ‚úÖ Strongly recommended  |
| Access keys deleted     | ‚úÖ Best practice         |
| CloudTrail monitored    | ‚úÖ Essential             |

# **IAM Credential Reports**
---

## üîç What is an **IAM Credential Report**?

The **IAM Credential Report** is a downloadable `.csv` file provided by AWS that shows the **age, status, and usage of credentials** (passwords, access keys, MFA) for **all IAM users in your account**.

It helps you **audit security best practices** and identify users who:

* Have old or unused passwords or access keys
* Lack MFA
* Haven't rotated keys recently
* Have enabled credentials that are unused

---

## üìÑ What Does the Credential Report Contain?

It contains **one row per IAM user**, and includes the following key columns:

| Column                             | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `user`                             | IAM username                                     |
| `arn`                              | Full ARN of the user                             |
| `user_creation_time`               | When the user was created                        |
| `password_enabled`                 | `true` if console login is enabled               |
| `password_last_used`               | Last time password was used                      |
| `password_last_changed`            | When password was last changed                   |
| `password_next_rotation`           | When it must be rotated (if rotation is enabled) |
| `mfa_active`                       | `true` if MFA is enabled                         |
| `access_key_1_active` / `2_active` | `true` if access key is enabled                  |
| `access_key_1_last_used_date`      | Last use of access key                           |
| `cert_1_active`                    | For X.509 certs (legacy, rarely used now)        |

# **IAM Access Advisor Reports** (part of **IAM Reports**) 
---

## üìò What Are IAM Access Advisor Reports?

**Access Advisor Reports** help you **analyze which AWS services your IAM users or roles actually use**, and when they last accessed them.

This allows you to:

* Identify **over-provisioned permissions**
* Clean up **unused access**
* Move toward **least-privilege access model**

---

## üß† Access Advisor vs Credential Reports

| Report Type        | Focus                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Credential Report  | Credential usage (keys, MFA, etc.) |
| **Access Advisor** | **Service-level access history**   |

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases for IAM Access Advisor

| üîç Goal                              | üí° Value                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Reduce over-permissioned IAM roles   | Know which services are *not being used* |
| Audit last accessed services         | Check stale/unused permissions           |
| Enforce least privilege              | Only allow what‚Äôs actually needed        |
| Role or user permission right-sizing | Clean up policies over time              |
| Compliance & risk reduction          | Reduce blast radius of access            |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use IAM Access Advisor Report (AWS Console)

### üîπ Step-by-Step for IAM **Users**

1. Go to **IAM ‚Üí Users**
2. Select a specific **IAM User**
3. Click the **‚ÄúAccess Advisor‚Äù** tab
4. You'll see:

   * **Service name**
   * **Last accessed time**
   * **Status: Accessed or Not accessed**

> üîé This shows which AWS services this user *has permission to use*, and when (or if) they actually used them.

---

### üîπ Step-by-Step for IAM **Roles**

1. Go to **IAM ‚Üí Roles**
2. Select a specific **IAM Role**
3. Click **Access Advisor**
4. Same report is shown: which services were accessed and when

---

## üìä Report Output Example

| Service    | Last Accessed Time | Accessed |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3  | 2025-06-22         | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| Amazon EC2 | None               | ‚ùå No     |
| IAM        | 2025-06-18         | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| CloudTrail | None               | ‚ùå No     |

üí° You could then remove EC2 and CloudTrail access if it's not needed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Filtering or Exporting Reports?

While **not directly downloadable via Console**, you can:

* Use **AWS CLI** to get similar data (see below)
* Use **Access Analyzer + CloudTrail** for deeper analysis

---

## üì¶ Access Advisor via AWS CLI (Per User or Role)

```bash
aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
  --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Deepak
```

Then fetch the details:

```bash
aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details \
  --job-id <job-id-from-previous-command>
```

Output includes:

* **Services last accessed**
* **Last authenticated time**
* **Actions allowed in each service**

---

## üß∞ Example: Use Case in DevOps

### üéØ Scenario: You have a role `EKSAdminRole` with full access to EC2, IAM, EKS, S3

Access Advisor shows:

| Service | Last Accessed |
| ------- | ------------- |
| EC2     | 2025-07-01    |
| S3      | Never         |
| IAM     | 2025-06-29    |
| EKS     | 2025-07-01    |

‚úÖ **Action**: Remove `s3:*` permissions from this role ‚Äî it‚Äôs not needed.

---

## üîê Best Practices Using Access Advisor

| Practice                                                  | Why                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Review Access Advisor monthly                             | Keep permissions clean           |
| Pair with CloudTrail logs                                 | Confirm usage patterns           |
| Combine with `aws:LastUsed` condition in policies         | Enforce conditional access       |
| Use with custom scripts or tools like PMapper/CloudMapper | Deeper analysis                  |
| Always test before removing permissions                   | Avoid breaking apps or pipelines |

# **IAM Access Analyzer**

---

## üîç What is **IAM Access Analyzer**?

**IAM Access Analyzer** helps you **identify resources in your AWS account that are shared externally** (outside your AWS Organization or account).

üîê It answers questions like:

* "Is this S3 bucket shared with the public?"
* "Is this role assumed by another AWS account?"
* "Is this KMS key shared with external users?"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd3f7c09-d676-4f56-b7f8-d8123ceea3bd)


---

## üì¶ What Can Access Analyzer Analyze?

IAM Access Analyzer reviews **resource-based policies** for the following:

| AWS Resource Type                              | Examples                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **S3 buckets**                                 | Public buckets, cross-account buckets |
| **IAM roles**                                  | Roles that trust external principals  |
| **KMS keys**                                   | Keys accessible from other accounts   |
| **Lambda functions**                           | Cross-account function access         |
| **SQS queues / SNS topics**                    | Externally accessible queues/topics   |
| **Secrets Manager secrets**                    | With cross-account access policies    |
| **EFS file systems**, **Glue resources**, etc. |                                       |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

IAM Access Analyzer:

1. **Creates an analyzer** scoped to your AWS account or AWS Organization.
2. **Continuously monitors** supported resources.
3. **Finds findings** where access is allowed to external entities.
4. Allows you to **archive or remediate** findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use IAM Access Analyzer (AWS Console)

### üîπ Step-by-Step: Creating an Analyzer

1. Open **IAM** in AWS Console
2. On left menu, click **‚ÄúAccess Analyzer‚Äù**
3. Click **‚ÄúCreate Analyzer‚Äù**
4. Choose:

   * **Zone of trust**: `Your AWS Account` or `AWS Organization`
   * **Analyzer name**: e.g., `prod-analyzer`
   * (Optional) Choose **Tags**
5. Click **Create Analyzer**

‚úÖ Done! Access Analyzer will now scan your account for external sharing.

---

### üîé Viewing Findings

* Go to **IAM ‚Üí Access Analyzer ‚Üí Findings**
* You‚Äôll see a list of all findings:

  * **Resource** (e.g., S3 bucket)
  * **Finding Type**: External access detected
  * **Status**: Active / Archived
  * **Condition**: e.g., Principal `*` has `s3:GetObject`

You can **click on each finding** to:

* View the JSON policy
* Download it
* Archive the finding (if it's known/allowed)
* Remediate the policy from the same screen

---

## üìä Example: S3 Bucket Exposed

### Detected Finding:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
  "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::deepak-public-data",
  "principal": "*",
  "action": "s3:GetObject",
  "effect": "Allow"
}
```

üõ°Ô∏è What it means: **Anyone on the internet** can access this bucket.

‚úÖ Fix: Update bucket policy to limit to a specific IAM principal or remove the `Allow` for `"Principal": "*"`.

---

## üìà Archive a Finding

Use **Archive** if access is intentional (e.g., sharing with another AWS account).

* Select finding ‚Üí Click **‚ÄúArchive‚Äù**
* You can **filter out archived findings** later

---

## üö® EventBridge Integration (Automation)

Access Analyzer integrates with **Amazon EventBridge**, so you can:

* Send finding notifications to **SNS**, **Slack**, or **email**
* Trigger **Lambda functions** to auto-remediate risky policies

Example EventBridge rule filter:

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.access-analyzer"],
  "detail-type": ["Access Analyzer Finding"]
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Using Access Analyzer via AWS CLI

### Create Analyzer

```bash
aws accessanalyzer create-analyzer \
  --analyzer-name my-analyzer \
  --type ACCOUNT
```

### List Findings

```bash
aws accessanalyzer list-findings \
  --analyzer-name my-analyzer
```

### Archive Finding

```bash
aws accessanalyzer archive-findings \
  --analyzer-name my-analyzer \
  --ids <finding-id>
```
