---

## üìò **Core Terminologies in Relational Databases (RDBMS)**

These concepts apply whether you're using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or any relational system ‚Äî including RDS.

---

### üß± **1. Table**

* A **table** is a collection of related data in rows and columns.
* Each table represents a single entity (like customers, orders, etc.).

üìå *Example:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### üîë **2. Primary Key**

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies each row in a table.
* It must be **unique** and **not null**.

üìå *Example:* `id` in the `Customers` table.

---

### üîó **3. Foreign Key**

* A **foreign key** links one table to another.
* It enforces **referential integrity** between related tables.

üìå *Example:* `customer_id` in `Orders` referencing `Customers(id)`

---

### üìö **4. Schema**

* A **schema** is a logical container for database objects like tables, views, and procedures.
* Think of it as a **namespace** or folder.

üìå *Example:* `public.customers` in PostgreSQL

---

### üßæ **5. Row (Record)**

* A **row** is a single entry in a table.
* It contains data for all columns defined.

üìå *Example:* One customer: `(1, 'Deepak', 'deepak@email.com')`

---

### üìê **6. Column (Field)**

* A **column** defines a data type and name for an attribute.
* Columns make up the structure of the table.

üìå *Example:* `name VARCHAR(100)` in the Customers table.

---

### üìã **7. SQL (Structured Query Language)**

* Language used to **interact with relational databases**.
* Includes commands like:

  * `SELECT` (read data)
  * `INSERT` (add data)
  * `UPDATE` (modify)
  * `DELETE` (remove)

üìå *Example:*

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### üîÑ **8. Normalization**

* Process of **organizing data** to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
* Involves splitting data into multiple related tables.

üìå *Example:* Instead of storing customer info in every order row, use a separate `Customers` table.

---

### üß† **9. Index**

* An **index** speeds up search queries on one or more columns.
* Acts like a book index ‚Äî you find data faster.

üìå *Example:* Index on `email` for fast user lookup.

---

### üîç **10. View**

* A **view** is a **virtual table** created by a query.
* It doesn't store data but presents data in a structured form.

üìå *Example:* A view showing active customers:

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE is_active = true;
```

---

### üîí **11. Transaction**

* A **transaction** is a group of SQL operations treated as a single unit.
* Follows **ACID** properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

üìå *Example:* Transferring money between accounts (debit + credit)

---

### üßæ **12. Constraint**

* Rules applied to columns or tables to enforce data integrity.
* Types: `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`

üìå *Example:* `email UNIQUE` ensures no duplicates.

---

‚úÖ **In Short:**
**AWS RDS = ‚ÄúRun relational DBs without worrying about infrastructure, while meeting performance, availability, and security requirements.‚Äù**

---

---

## üèóÔ∏è **1. Explanation of All 3 Deployment Models**

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **A. On-Premises Database**

* You **install and manage the DB** on your own physical servers (in your data center).
* You handle **everything**: power, network, hardware, OS, patches, backups, scaling.

üìå *Use Case:* Organizations with strict data control, compliance needs, or legacy systems.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **B. Database on Amazon EC2**

* You launch a **virtual machine (EC2)** and install the DB engine (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) yourself.
* You control the OS, DB engine, backups, scaling, patching, and failover.
* **More flexibility**, but **more management** too.

üìå *Use Case:* Custom DB configurations not supported by RDS or need OS-level control.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **C. Database on Amazon RDS (Managed)**

* You **just choose the DB engine**, version, size, and backup settings ‚Äî AWS handles the rest.
* No OS-level access, but you get built-in HA, backups, read replicas, monitoring, and security.

üìå *Use Case:* Modern, scalable, production-ready applications with minimal admin effort.

---

## üìä **2. Comparison Table**

| Feature/Factor         | On-Premises                   | EC2 Hosted DB                    | Amazon RDS (Managed)                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Setup Time**         | Weeks (hardware, software)    | Hours (launch EC2, install DB)   | Minutes (console/CLI setup)         |
| **Control**            | Full (hardware, OS, DB)       | High (OS + DB control)           | Limited (only DB settings)          |
| **Maintenance**        | Manual (patches, backups)     | Manual (you manage it all)       | Automated by AWS                    |
| **Scaling**            | Hardware upgrade (slow)       | Manual (resize EC2/volume)       | Easy (Auto storage scaling, Aurora) |
| **High Availability**  | Custom, complex setup         | DIY with scripts, Load Balancers | Built-in (Multi-AZ, Aurora HA)      |
| **Monitoring**         | Custom tools                  | Use CloudWatch manually          | Integrated with CloudWatch          |
| **Backup/Restore**     | Manual, script-based          | Manual snapshots/scripts         | Auto backups, point-in-time restore |
| **Cost**               | High CapEx (servers, cooling) | Pay for EC2, EBS, ops time       | Pay-as-you-go, cost-efficient       |
| **Compliance & Audit** | Custom controls               | Full control, but manual         | AWS compliance (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)   |
| **Use Case Fit**       | Legacy, strict control needed | Custom setup, migration/testing  | Modern apps, fast delivery, DevOps  |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **1. Create a Database in MySQL**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE deepak_db;
```

> ‚úÖ Use underscores (`_`) instead of hyphens (`-`) in DB names to avoid quoting issues.

---

## üìå **2. Select the Database to Use**

Before creating tables or inserting data, select the DB:

```sql
USE deepak_db;
```

> ‚úÖ This makes `deepak_db` the **active/default database** for the current session.

---

## üí° **3. Do I Need to Mention the DB Name Every Time?**

### ‚ùå **No ‚Äî If you've already run:**

```sql
USE deepak_db;
```

Then this is valid:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### ‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî If you didn‚Äôt use `USE`**

You must fully qualify the table name like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE deepak_db.employee (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

## üß™ Example: Full Setup

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE deepak_db;

-- Use database
USE deepak_db;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'Deepak');

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

## üß™ **Lab: EC2 to RDS MySQL Connection ‚Äì Full Steps via AWS Console**

---

### ‚úÖ **Goal**

* Create a **MySQL RDS instance**
* Launch an **EC2 instance**
* **Connect to the RDS** from EC2 using MySQL client

---

## üîß **Step-by-Step Instructions**

---

### üîπ **Step 1: Create RDS MySQL Instance**

1. Go to **Amazon RDS Console** ‚Üí Click **Create database**
2. Choose:

   * Creation method: ‚úÖ *Standard create*
   * Engine: ‚úÖ *MySQL*
   * Version: Default or latest 8.x
   * Template: ‚úÖ *Free tier*
3. Settings:

   * DB instance identifier: `deepak-rds-mysql`
   * Username: `admin`
   * Password: `StrongPassword123!`
4. DB instance size:

   * Instance class: `db.t3.micro`
   * Storage: General Purpose (20 GiB)
5. Connectivity:

   * VPC: Select default or custom
   * Public access: ‚ùå *No*
   * VPC Security Group: **Create new or choose existing**, allow **port 3306**
6. DB name: `deepak_db` (optional)
7. Click **Create database**
8. Wait for **status = available** and note the **endpoint** (e.g., `deepak-rds-mysql.abcxyz.rds.amazonaws.com`)

---

### üîπ **Step 2: Create EC2 Instance (Linux)**

1. Go to **EC2 Console** ‚Üí Launch Instance
2. Name: `deepak-ec2-mysql-client`
3. AMI: ‚úÖ *Amazon Linux 2*
4. Instance type: `t2.micro`
5. Key pair: Select or create new
6. Network settings:

   * VPC: Same as RDS
   * Subnet: Choose one in same AZ (optional)
   * Security Group:

     * Allow SSH (port 22)
     * Allow **outbound access** to **RDS port 3306**
7. Launch instance
8. Connect to instance:

   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
   ```

---

### üîπ **Step 3: Install MySQL Client on EC2**

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install mysql -y
# if not working we can install using mariadb as mariadb and mysql are almost same
sudo dnf install mariadb105
```

---

### üîπ **Step 4: Modify RDS Security Group to Allow EC2 Access**

1. Go to **EC2 Console** ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Note the **private IP** of your EC2
2. Go to **RDS Console** ‚Üí Your DB ‚Üí Find its **Security Group**
3. Edit **Inbound Rules**:

   * Type: MySQL/Aurora
   * Port: 3306
   * Source: ‚úÖ *EC2's Security Group* OR *EC2‚Äôs Private IP/32*

‚úÖ This allows EC2 to talk to the RDS.

---

### üîπ **Step 5: Connect to RDS from EC2**

1. Run:

   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS-ENDPOINT> -u admin -p
   ```

   * Enter password: `StrongPassword123!`

2. Once connected:

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;

   CREATE DATABASE deepak_db;
   USE deepak_db;

   CREATE TABLE users (
     id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(100)
   );

   INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Deepak');
   SELECT * FROM users;
   ```

‚úÖ You‚Äôre now connected from EC2 to RDS securely using internal networking.
